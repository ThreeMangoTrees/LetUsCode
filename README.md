## Submission Process

* Fork LetUsCode:main branch from this github repo into your github repo.
* Clone the branch locally.
* Create a directory by your name e.g. VinitKumar. Inside this directory create another directory Problems. Add solution to a problem in this directory.
* Add solution to each problem in a separate file. E.g. Add solution to Problem 1 in Problem1.* file.
* Push the code changes to your remote branch created in first step.
* Create a pull request for the code you pushed to your github repo.


## Problems
### Tree
* Problem 1 - Create a binary tree. Also write inorder traversal for the tree.
* Problem 2 - Use the same binary tree in the previous question. Write pre-order and post-order traversal for the tree.
* Problem 3 - Create a Binary Search Tree (BST). Write in-order, pre-order and post-order traversal for it. Check which traversal outputs the nodes in ascending order.
* Problem 4 - Create 2 trees. Check if both the trees have same or different nodes. Execute for 3 conditions - 1. when both trees have same nodes. 2. When both trees have different nodes. 3. When both trees have some common nodes.
